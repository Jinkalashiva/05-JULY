     <p><b><u>1.What is a Programming language?</B></u><br>
1. A <b>programming language</b> is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a 
computer.<br> 
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data 
analysis, and automation.<br> 
3. Examples: C, Java, Python, JavaScript.<br>
<b><u>2.Why Python?</b></U> <br>
1. <b>Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners. <br>
2. <b>Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, 
functional). <br>
3. <b>Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web 
development.<br> 
4. <b>Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning. <br>
5. <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br>
6. <b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification 
(Windows, macOS, Linux).<br> 
7.<b> Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications 
when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g., Django) <br>
<b><u>3.What is Python?</b></u> <br>
1. <b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and 
readability. It was created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> in the late 1980s and first released in <b>1991</b>. 
Python emphasizes <b>code readability</b> and supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
<b>object-oriented, procedural,</b> and <b>functional programming.</b> <br>
a. Monty Python’s Flying Circus  <br>
2. Older than Java (1995).<br>  
<b><u>4.Where Python is Used?</b></u><br>
1<b>. Web Development:</b> Frameworks: Django, Flask. <br>
2. <b>Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy, 
Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn. <br>
3. <b>Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks.<br> 
4. <b>Game Development:</b> Framework: PyGame.<br> 
5. <b>Scientific Computing:</b> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.<br> 
6. <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.<br> 
7. <b>Web Scraping:</b> Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.<br> 
8. <b>Cybersecurity:</b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.<br> 
<b><u>5.Which Companies using Python?</b></u><br> Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM, 
10000 coders dashboard <br>
<b><u>6.Disadvantages of Python?</b></u> <br>
1. Slower Execution Speed <br> 
○ Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. <br> 
○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming 
engines). <br>
2. Memory Consumption <br>
○ Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage. <br>
○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial. <br>
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) <br>
○ The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time. <br>
○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core 
processors. <br>
4. Runtime Errors <br>
○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested.<br> 
○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly.<br> 
5. Limited Support for Low-Level Programming <br>
○ Languages like C or Rust are better suited for such tasks.<br>

<b><u>7.Python Installation?</b></u> <br>

1. Download link: Download Python | Python.org <br>

2. Commands to check installations: <br>

a. In cmd: python --version<br>
<b><u>8.Different Modes of python Working?</b></u> <br>
 Python provides various modes to write and execute code, each suited 
for different workflows and purposes.<br>
 
1. Interactive Mode: Python code is executed directly in the Python shell or terminal.<br>
 
a. In cmd: type py or python to enter into the python shell. <br>

i. 
exit() to come out of the python shell. <br>

b. Search idle in the window's search to directly enter the python shell. <br>

2. Script Mode: 
a. Write Python programs in a .py file and execute them as a whole. <br>

b. Run using the command: python filename.py. <br>

3. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): 
a. Use tools like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code for an enhanced coding 
experience. <br>

b. Offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and autocompletion.<br>
<b><u>9.What is Variables in Python? </b></u> <br>

a. A variable is a container. Called a variable because we can change the value of a 
variable.<br>

 
b. Snake Case for variables ( using _’s), Pascalcase for class names, All caps for 
constants <br>


c. There are no constants in python. You can only show your intention by writing All Capital 
letters.<br>
<b><u>10.What is Datatypes in Python? </b></u> <br>
DataTypes (All these are classes) <br>
a. Built In data types: <br>
i. 
Numeric – int, float, complex, bool <br>
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 
v. 
Sequence Type – string, list, tuple, Range<br>  
1. There are no characters in Python. They are also strings 
Mapping Type – dictionary (Key and Value pairs) 
Set Type – Set 
None <br>
1.  
b. Custom data types: <br>
i. 
User defined classes: Custom data types are user-defined classes that can 
define their own attributes and methods. <br>
3. Numeric Data types: Numeric types are used to store numerical values. <br>
a. int: Integer values (whole numbers). <br>
b. float: Floating-point numbers (decimal values).<br> 
c. complex: Numbers with real and imaginary parts.<br> 
d. bool: Boolean values (True or False).<br>
<b><u>11.What is Operators in Python? </b></u> <br>
Operators <br>

1. Arithmetic operators - (+, -, *, /, //, ** etc)  <br>

a. / is float division <br>

b. // is integer division <br>

2. Assignment operators - (=, +=, -=, *= etc) <br>

a. a,b = 2, 3 <br>

b. n = -n <br>

3. Relational operators - (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) <br>

4. Logical operators - (and, or, not) <br>

a. Truthy and Falsy values in Python # Falsy: 0, 0.0, '', None, False, [], {}, (), set()<br>
